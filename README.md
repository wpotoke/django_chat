I've significantly improved the chat application's functionality, reliability, and user experience. Here's a concise overview of the key changes:

Core Improvements:
Complete UI Redesign
   - Implemented dark theme with modern message bubbles
   - Split layout (sidebar for members + main chat area)
   - Distinct styling for system messages vs user messages

Enhanced WebSocket Implementation
   - Automatic reconnection logic
   - Better error handling
   - Separated message processing into dedicated functions

New Features:
   - Message timestamps
   - Visual distinction for own messages
   - Proper join/leave notifications
   - Auto-scrolling to new messages

Code Quality Upgrades:
   - Better organized JavaScript (modular functions)
   - Improved DOM handling
   - More reliable member list updates
   - Input validation and sanitization

Removed Legacy Code:
   - Old textarea-based display
   - Basic WebSocket implementation
   - Minimalist styling

The chat now offers a more polished experience while being more stable and maintainable under the hood. The new structure also makes it easier to add future enhancements.
